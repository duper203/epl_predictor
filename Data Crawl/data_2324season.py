## 2 - Score : 3-1 -> 3 & 1 in different column

# split by '-'

## 3 - Delete "Match Report" column
shooting.drop(columns=['Match Report'], inplace=True)
shooting.drop(columns=['Notes'], inplace=True)

##4 - Delete Rows that are blank == no matches
shooting = shooting[shooting['Wk'] != 0]

##5 - Sorted by 'Wk' of matches (for example: one of the week 2 matches was on 2023-10-03)
shooting.sort_values(by=['Date', 'Wk'], inplace=True)
